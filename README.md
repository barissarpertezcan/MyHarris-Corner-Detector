# My Harris Corner Detector

Corners are considered good features to recognize objects. This repo contains my own implementation of well known Harris Corner Detector using Sobel Filter based on [OpenCV documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/dc/d0d/tutorial_py_features_harris.html) and the paper [A Combined Corner and Edge Detector](http://www.bmva.org/bmvc/1988/avc-88-023.pdf) published by Chris Harris & Mike Stephens.

## Installation and Usage

Clone the repository and run the harris_corner_test.py

```bash
git clone https://github.com/barissarpertezcan/MyHarris-Corner-Detector
python3 harris_corner_test.py
```
